#### Description:
This project is a full-stack web application designed to provide a seamless user experience for managing listings, chatting, and user authentication. The application is built with a combination of modern technologies, including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Passport.js, to handle the core functionality. Users can sign up, log in, and create ads to engage with other users in real-time chat. The app also supports dynamic views with EJS templating, giving the interface flexibility for rendering content based on user data.

The goal of this application is to provide a simple yet robust platform where users can interact with each other, post ads, and communicate. The project demonstrates how to implement features such as user authentication, session management, and a real-time messaging system in a web application.

### Features:
- **User Authentication:** The app allows users to securely register, log in, and manage their sessions using Passport.js with local authentication. The authentication system ensures that only authorized users can access certain features, such as posting ads or viewing private messages.
- **Message System:** A real-time chat feature enables users to send and receive messages. The app uses WebSocket-based connections to allow instant communication between users without the need to reload the page.
- **Listings:** Users can create, view, and manage ads. These ads are stored in MongoDB and can be retrieved by any user accessing the app. This feature facilitates the exchange of information or services within a specific community.
- **Flash Messages:** The app uses `connect-flash` to notify users of successes, errors, or any other events during their interactions, such as successfully logging in or encountering an error when submitting an ad.
- **EJS Views:** The app leverages EJS as its templating engine to dynamically render pages based on data. It allows for the creation of reusable components and provides a clean way to separate the logic from the view.
- **Session Management:** The app uses Express sessions to store and manage user sessions. MongoDB is used to persist the session data, ensuring that users stay logged in across different page requests and visits.

### Technologies Used:
- **Node.js:** The application is built on top of Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable and fast applications.
- **Express.js:** This framework simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and building the backend logic of the web application. It provides a robust set of features for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose:** MongoDB is used as the database for storing user and ad data, while Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a schema-based solution to model data in MongoDB.
- **Passport.js:** This middleware is used for handling user authentication. It supports multiple strategies for logging in users, including local authentication with a username and password.
- **EJS & EJS-Mate:** The EJS templating engine is used for dynamically rendering views. `ejs-mate` is a layout engine for EJS that simplifies the process of handling layouts and partials.
- **Flash Messages:** The app uses the `connect-flash` middleware for displaying one-time messages, such as success or error notifications, to users.
- **Session Management:** Session management is handled using the `express-session` middleware, and session data is stored in MongoDB via `connect-mongo`. This ensures that users remain logged in even after refreshing the page.

### Project Architecture:
This application follows a standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:
- **Models:** The data models represent the structure of the application's data and are defined using Mongoose. The User model handles user data, while the Ad model manages information about the listings. 
- **Views:** The views are handled by EJS templates. These templates are rendered dynamically based on user interaction and server-side data, providing a responsive experience for users.
- **Controllers:** The route handlers (controllers) are responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the database, and rendering appropriate views. For example, routes for user registration and login, displaying ads, and sending messages are defined in separate route files.

### Setup:
Follow the steps below to set up and run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   This project uses environment variables to store sensitive information like the database URL and session secrets. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
   ```
   DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db-name
   SECRET=your-session-secret
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set up, you can start the application by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the app on your local machine, and you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Accessing the App:**
   Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should be able to see the home page and access different features of the application, such as user registration, ad posting, and messaging.

### Running in Production:
For deploying the app in a production environment (e.g., on Vercel, Heroku, or AWS), ensure that you have configured the environment variables correctly. Additionally, make sure to set up a production-ready MongoDB database, such as MongoDB Atlas, and adjust session settings to use secure cookies for added protection.

### Contribution:

### Future Enhancements:
This project can be further enhanced by adding more features and improvements:
- **User Profile Pages:** Users can have their own profile pages where they can manage their ads, view their message history, and update personal details.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Implement notifications that alert users when they receive a new message or when there are updates to ads they are interested in.
- **File Uploads:** Add functionality for users to upload images for their ads, making them more visually appealing.
- **Search and Filter Ads:** Implement a search feature that allows users to filter ads based on categories, keywords, or locations.
- **Better Error Handling:** Improve the error handling to display user-friendly messages and handle edge cases more effectively.
